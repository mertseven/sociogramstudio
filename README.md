## Key Features

*   **Interactive D3.js Visualization:** A force-directed graph that brings your network to life. Drag nodes, zoom, and pan to explore relationships.
*   **Advanced Sociometric Metrics:** The app goes beyond simple counts to calculate:
    *   **Sociometric Status:** Automatically classifies individuals as Popular, Rejected, Controversial, Neglected, or Average based on standardized scores.
    *   **Betweenness Centrality:** Identifies crucial "bridge" individuals who connect different parts of the network.
*   **Clique Analysis:** Instantly finds and highlights all maximal cliques (tightly-knit subgroups) within the network based on positive ties.
*   **Dynamic Filtering & Customization:**
    *   Color-code nodes by different metrics (Status, Degree, Centrality, etc.).
    *   Toggle the visibility of positive and negative relationship links.
    *   Filter the graph to show only the most connected individuals.
    *   Adjust force-simulation parameters like link distance and charge strength in real-time.
*   **Client-Side Privacy:** **Your data never leaves your browser.** All processing and analysis happens locally, ensuring 100% privacy and security.
*   **Easy Data Entry:**
    *   Manually add data row by row.
    *   Import data quickly from a `.csv` file.
*   **Export Your Work:** Download your final sociogram as a high-resolution PNG image for reports, presentations, or publications.

## Running Locally

To run Sociogram Studio on your local machine, you'll need a simple local web server because the application uses ES Modules, which are blocked by browser security policies when running from a local `file://` URL.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mertseven/sociogram-studio.git
    cd sociogram-studio
    ```

2.  **Start a local server:**
    *   **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        # For Python 2
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
    *   **Using Node.js (requires `npx`):**
        ```bash
        npx http-server
        ```

3.  **Open in your browser:**
